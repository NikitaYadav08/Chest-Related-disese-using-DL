# Chest-Related-disese-using-DL
🩺  Chest-Related Disease Identifier using DL (Pneumonia, Breast Cancer, and Tuberculosis)
🩺 Multi Chest-Related Disease Identifier
Technologies: Python, Deep Learning, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV

This project is designed to automatically identify multiple chest-related diseases using deep learning. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system processes medical chest X-ray images and accurately classifies them into categories such as Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and Breast Cancer.

🔍 Key Features:
Multi-Disease Classification: Detects and classifies multiple chest-related conditions using image input.

Deep Learning Models: Built with custom CNN architectures using TensorFlow/Keras for reliable performance.

High Accuracy: Achieved strong results with optimized model design and data preprocessing techniques.

Modular Codebase: Easily extendable to include more diseases or updated models.

🧠 Model Workflow:
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for improved training.

Model Training: CNN models trained on high-quality, publicly available datasets.

Performance Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix used for evaluation.

Image Prediction: The model outputs disease classification based on the uploaded X-ray image.

📁 Datasets Used:
Chest X-Ray dataset (e.g., NIH ChestX-ray14, Kaggle Pneumonia/TB datasets)

Breast Cancer Histopathological image datasets (if applicable)

🛠️ Future Work:
Add more diseases such as COVID-19 or lung cancer

Improve localization with segmentation models

Optimize for real-time performance
